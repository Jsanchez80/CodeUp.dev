			    <dt class="question"> Q: What happened to the old Chalet?</dt>
			    <dd class="invisible">The chalet was a dilapidated building which was deconstructed in June 2005 to make way for the new visitor center. Furthermore, the chalet was not a visitor center and minimally served the public in the summer season only. It was originally constructed to host skiers through the winter season in the early 1960s. Much of the building was recycled including beams and concrete.
