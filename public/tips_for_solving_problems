pattern for setting up a problem/solving a problem:
process of visualization
input--> process-->output

Read the exercise
what's the real problem
whats the output that we're to product?
what's the given input?
what are the other specifications? validation?
attention to detail/spotting differences
take notes of what you want the code to do, where and in what order
read the exercise
figure out your variables
input--> process-->output

figure out your variables
	-what stuff changes (what inputs neet to be worked on)
	-what stuff get repeated (strings in the output)
	-what stuff stays the same just once
		-naming the nouns
			-subTotal
			-taxAmount
			-taxPercentage
			-discountAmount
			-discountPercentage
			-finalTotal

Write out pseudo-code
	(usually write this in comments, because you don't want your code to act haywire)
		-defining inputs
		-try out variable names (expect that they may change)
		-defining process
			-what verbs need to happen to what nouns
			-what does each verb do 
			-what's the order of the verba
			-after a verb happens to a noun, does that mean we need a new noun name to hold the reuslt
		-making your output match the specification
		-do we need a loop? does the lopp need to happen at least once?
		
code small things
once your specific problem is small enough, google exactly how to do it
"how to generate a random number in javascript"
Start converting tiny pieces of pseduocode into real code, take it from the top
what did happen vs. what you expected to hapen?
does it make sense?
revisit variable (and function names) to see if they make sense?

make small working pieces?
use small working piecs in larger solutions

revisit the entire solution, read the problem
improve the accuracy and corretness
improve the readability of your code

## debugging
use strict at the top of your script
double check your file paths
did you move the file while working on it, and you're editing one file while testing a different copy in the browser?
doble check for link paths
bring up your JS console to look for syntax errors or 404's
try small things
change onle one thing
what as the expected vs. actual result
change it back, try something different
hold as many things constant as possible
	-comment stuff out that doesn't work
console.log all the things (or you'll be flying blind)
